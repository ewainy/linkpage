      <p>Hello lovelies 😊 My name is Emma, I'm 30 years old and I live in <span>Manchester, UK</span> 🇬🇧</p>
      <p>I have been teaching myself to code for over a year now, I wanted to be productive with my time on furlough and it became addictive! I started with learning <span>HTML | CSS | JavaScript</span>.
      </p> <p> I love to learn new technologies and concepts, I am particularly interested in <span>front-end development</span> as I am a visual and creative person! 
          I'm also passionate about <span>Jamstack</span> because the possibilities are endless, it feels like magic! 🧙🏻‍♀️</p>
         <p>I have recently finished an intensive 9 week bootcamp in <span>Software Development</span> ran by QA Ltd. where I covered topics in Agile Methodologies | Git/ Github | Networking & Security | DevOps
          | <span>SQL</span> | Python | <span>Java</span>  | Azure Fundamentals. </p> 
          <p>I am now spending my time revisiting <span>React</span> and engaging with the tech community on Twitter 😊
          Whilst I am off, I want to carry on learning and building projects aswell as contribute to open source.</p>
          <p>I am actively open to hearing about opportunities in <span>web development</span> or <span>developer advocacy</span>🥑
        </p>
