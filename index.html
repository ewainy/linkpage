      <p>Hello lovelies 😊 My name is Emma, I'm 31 years old and I live in <span>Manchester, UK</span> 🇬🇧</p>
        <p>I am a career changer, I went from being a <span>beauty therapist</span> 💆🏼‍♀️💅🏻 to a <span>technical consultant</span> 👩🏼‍💻</p>
        <p>  I started with learning <span>HTML | CSS | JavaScript</span> on furlough and my passion quickly grew from there! </p>
        <p> I love to learn new technologies and concepts, especially anything to do with <span>front-end development | UX/UI design | Accessibility</span>.
          I'm also passionate about <span>Jamstack</span> because the possibilities are endless, it feels like magic! 🧙🏻‍♀️</p>
         <p>I completed an intensive 9 week bootcamp in <span>Software Development</span> ran by QA Ltd in October 2021, where I covered topics in Agile Methodologies | Git/ Github | Networking & Security | DevOps
          | <span>SQL</span> | Python | <span>Java</span>  | Azure Fundamentals. </p> 
        <p> I started my new career in tech January of this year and I am loving every minute of it, I am learning so much and get to do a variety of work and meet so many amazing people!
            Feel so blessed to have such an opportunity ✨</p>
          <p>In my spare time, my intention is to carry on learning and building projects, aswell as contribute to <span>open source</span>
         </p> 
        <p>I also love engaging with the <span>tech community </span>on Twitter 🐦 and want to use my platform to help inspire people and bring people together. 
            I love to cheer people on and support in any way I can 🎉 All about the <span>positive vibes</span>✌ Spread a little <span>love and kindness</span> 💖</p>
